# Numlock-Indicator
A simple numlock indicator for Windows.
The only thing I changed is an icon – instead of Google Calc icon there is simple dot, showing NumLock button status.


# Icon

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Myron472/Numlock-Indicator-Dot-Icon/master/images/off.png"/>
Green dot means Numlock is on, white – off.

# Misc
