# Numlock-Indicator-Dot-Icon
A simple numlock indicator for Windows. Doesn't require installation.

The only thing I changed is an icon – instead of calculator icon there is simple dot, showing NumLock button status.

How to make NumPadIndicator (and any other Windows program) startup on launch:
1. Press Win + R and type shell:startup
2. Put a shortcut of the program to the opened directory.

# Icon
Green dot means Numlock is on, white – off.

I also put SVG and AFDESIGN icon files into **/icon** directory in case if you want to modify my icon.

# Misc
If you want another icon in program you can go to the original author's [project page](https://github.com/determ1ne/Numlock-Indicator) and fork it. To build application  you will need to install [Masm32 Assembler SDK](masm32.com).
