# Numlock-Indicator
A simple numlock indicator for Windows.
The only thing I changed is an icon – instead of Google Calc icon there is simple dot, showing NumLock button status.


# Icon
Green dot means Numlock is on, white – off.

# Misc
If you want to suggest any idea to the project go to the original author's [project page](https://github.com/determ1ne/Numlock-Indicator).
